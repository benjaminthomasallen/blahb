Vision Statement
 
This game is to provide a tactical challenge to the players. 
This is done by having to manage your own army, carefully using power spots to get an edge in battle, 
gather resources to expand your army, all while having to fight your opponent at the same time.

The idea of this game is that on a map two players will control their own armies on opposing sides. 
They will then fight eachother using these maps as well as defending their own bases.
Throughout the maps there will be power spots, the players will utilize these spots to either know the 
location of the enemy's power spots, or location of their army. There will also be a resource area in the map 
where the players will be able to gather resources and use them at their bases to buy more army units.
The winner is decided upon who succesfully destroys the opponents base.
